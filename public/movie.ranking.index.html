<h1>Best Thrillers I Watched in 2023!</h1>

   <h3> #1 The Girl On The Train</h3>
   <p> Based on the book with the same name, this movie was thrilling to the end. You wonder who is actually not being real. Is it the alcoholic unemployed woman making up stories as she rides the train back and forth to London? Or did what she see actually happen?

    <h3>#2 Bullet Train</h3>
    <p>This movie stars Brad Pitt and a host of other famous actors. It takes place on a bullet train through Japan and is a thrilling ride the whole way. Who are the bad guys? What is actually happening?</p>
<br />
<h3>#3 Only the Brave</h3>
<p>This isn't a mystery whodunit type of thriller but suspense in the sense that your heart is racing due to the nature of the reality of a fire blazing across Arizona and the firefighters on the front line. It's based on a true story and that makes the ending that much more powerful once you know and have been immersed in the whole story.
